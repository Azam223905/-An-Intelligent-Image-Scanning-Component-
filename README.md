# An Intelligent Image Scanning Component

A project focused on developing an intelligent image-scanning component that automatically analyzes, classifies, and extracts essential features from digital images using artificial intelligence and computer-vision techniques.

## Abstract
This project aims to design a modular image-scanning component that performs preprocessing, detection, and analysis of digital images using AI algorithms. It provides a flexible structure so that future models and APIs can be integrated easily. The outcome will support tasks like document digitization, object detection, and feature recognition for academic and industrial use.
